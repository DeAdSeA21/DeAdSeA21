# About me

### I know my username is ~~DeAdSeA21~~ but like just call Shikaine please

## Education
I'm working on getting my bachelors in both Computer Science and Computer Engineering right now. I didn't really want to go to college but was forced so yeah.

## Languages
I don't know many languages, but I have put a decent chunk of time into java; it's definitely what I'm most comfortable in. I have a tad bit of experience in C++, but that dumb ahh language can blow me (*I'm still practicing it occasionally*). What I really want to learn tho is JavaScript, CSS, HTML and Python.

## Projects
I love games like every other loser on the internet, so, yes, I want to work on a game *even if it's just gonna be a visual novel*. I don't have any current projects though. I'd love to start working with other people on projects and getting into more serious coding adventures, but I have no friends teehee. **PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME I BEG**.
